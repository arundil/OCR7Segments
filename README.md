# OCR7Segments
An Android App thats detect a Region of Interest and reads the OCR Number with Tesseract, Leptonica and OpenCV

This app uses tess-two (A fork of Tesseract Tools for Android) https://github.com/rmtheis/tess-two 
Also I used OpenCV for detecting the Region of Interest and also for image enhacement. 

The best way to work with this source code is downloading Eclipse for Android developers. 

Android SDK supported between 8 and and 23. Anyways, it is recommended to use as minimum SDK 14 or upper.
